Solve the following problems with python programming language 

#1.Write a program that convert percentage to decimal.
#Example: Enter percentage: 125% 
#Equivalent decimal: 1.25


#2. Question 3. Write a program to convert temperature from Centigrade (C’) to Fahrenheit (F’) 
#Far=1.8Cel+32


#3.Write a program that asks the user to enter a whole number of inches and convert that length to feet and inches. See the following figure. The program should use both integer division and the modulus operator. 
#Examples: Enter number of Inches: 185
#185 inches if 15 feet and 5 inches



#4. A copy center charges 50 won per copy for the first 100 copies and 30 won per copy for each additional copy. 
#Write a program that requests the number as input and displays the total cost. 


#5. A calendar year divisible by four is a leap year, with the exception of the years ending in 00 (that is, those divisible by 100) and not divisible by 400. For instance the years 1600 and 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not. 
#Write a program that requests a year as input and states whether it is a leap year. 
#parameters = "/?access_token=%s" % (access_token)

#6. Print average of all numbers divisible by 3 and less than 100.

#7. A person born in 1980 can claim, "I will be x years old in the year x squared." '. What is the value of x?
#Hints: It forms a quadratic equation X^2-X-1980=0

#8. A list has 6 numbers. Print sum of the smallest and largest number, 
#sum of second smallest and second largest, and sum of third smallest and third largest number.

#9. Make a list with 10 numbers and print: (a) the difference between average number and smallest number, and 
    #(b) difference between average and largest number.


#10.  Write a python program to find area of a triangle. Inputs are the 3 sides of triangle.
